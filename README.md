# Heresphere_VR_Video_Indexer
Heresphere_VR_Video_Indexer

Index all videos on a page. Places in file next to "Mainer.exe" upon completion. 

The plan is to have this file get uploaded to a directory online the user can use. Right now I upload it to my own github and bookmark it on Heresphere. 

In the future I will have a plan to handle the final step.

To run, add Selenium Chromedriver.exe latest as of 11/15/22
